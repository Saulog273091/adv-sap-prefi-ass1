## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).

- Service Oriented Architecture is a architecture that guides users in developing a software where they use the used components 
or services of the software to create something new.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

- There are 9 characteristics of SOA, the first one is Standardized Service Contrracts is the need to believe or follow a certain service description for the user's satisfaction.
Next one is Loose Coupling, where it needs to lessen the dependencies of a service to another to create boundaries with less vulnerability. 
Another is Abrastraction that hides unnecessary information to the client which might lead to confusion. 
Next is Service Reusability where they use an old service to create multiple new services. 
Another one is Autonomy which it needs to be precise when it comes to the logic to avoid misinformation or confusion. 
Next is Statelessness where it should not be too complicated so that it can be recycled or improved. 
Another one is Discoverability where the service should be easy to access to avoid unreliability. 
Next one is Composability which the services should be reliable in terms of solving problems with a composed process for it to be effecient. 
Last one is Interoperability which means that the service should be flexible in terms of other users.

3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices are architectures that makes reusable and new components but rather than making it in a single
application, they create a new application with each component for the services be more flexible and spacewise.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

- There are 3 main benefits of using microservices, and the first one is microservices is independently deployable.
Being an independent services lessens deadlocks when it comes with communication because of the bounderies that they have and due of the service having applications individually.
Second is it is Right tool for the job, where each services has it own application which is good for communication with minumum interferance. 
Lastly, it's Precise Scaling, as mentioned earlier that services can be individually deployed, then it can be monitored properly with minimum errors.


5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

- The difference of Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices is SOA is an enterprise-wide effort architecture
which means that it works generally. On the other hand, Microservices is an application-specific that means it works
specifically.
For the similarities of the two, both architectures reuse a component and create a new specialized component that helps
a certain process
